        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Here is a simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in minutes. It's made from
            ingredients that
            everyone has on hand.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water,
                stirring
                to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the
                griddle,
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats
                the
                surface evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and
                cook
                the other side. Serve hot.
            </li>
        </ol>
